# Work Plan
Each member of the team is responsible for developing one data plugin and one visualization plugin after the framework has been implemented. Members are expected to work in their own branch and submit PR for code to be reviewed before merging into the master master. Code in the master branch should remain bug-free and pass all tests (after tests have been implemented).
## Timeline
Tentative timeline for Milestone B as follows:
- 4/09 Finalization of the framework and plugin interfaces
- 4/12 Completion of framework implementation
- 4/13 Completion of data plugin implementation
- 4/14 Completion of visualization plugin implementation
- 4/14 Completion of front-end design
- 4/17 Completion of front-end implementation
